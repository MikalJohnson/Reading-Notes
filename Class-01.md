## Getting Started

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.

- When HTML is parsed, it leads to the browser recognizing any **links** to CSS stylesheets and any **Script** to any JS files in that order.

- To add an image you can search through Google images, and to reduce the chances of violating copyrights click on the *tools* button, then *Usage rights*, and choose *Creative Commons*.

- let string = "This is a string";
- let number = 24;

- **Variables** are containers that stores values. You declare variables with *var*, *let*, *const*.

## Introduction to HTML

- An HTML **Attributes** contains extra information about the element that wont't appear in the content.

- An **Element** is made up of: The opening tag, the content, and the closing.

- **Article** encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page, for example: a single blog post.

- **Section** is similar to *Article*, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one singel piece of functionality, for example: a mini map.

- A typical website usually has a *header* *nav-bar* *main* *sidebar* *footer*.

- **MetaData** makes your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines.
