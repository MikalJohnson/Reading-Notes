# Read Class 01

## Getting Started

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.

- When HTML is parsed, it leads to the browser recognizing any **links** to CSS stylesheets and any **Script** to any JS files in that order.

- To add an image you can search through Google images, and to reduce the chances of violating copyrights click on the *tools* button, then *Usage rights*, and choose *Creative Commons*.

- let string = "This is a string";
- let number = 24;

- **Variables** are containers that stores values. You declare variables with *var*, *let*, *const*.

## Introduction to HTML

- An HTML **Attributes** contains extra information about the element that wont't appear in the content.

- An **Element** is made up of: The opening tag, the content, and the closing.

- **Article** encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page, for example: a single blog post.

- **Section** is similar to *Article*, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one singel piece of functionality, for example: a mini map.

- A typical website usually has a *header* *nav-bar* *main* *sidebar* *footer*.

- **MetaData** makes your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines.

## Miscellaneous

- First step of every project is to define what you want to accomplish with it.

- What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals.

## Semantics

- I would use an *h1* tag over a *span* tag when im trying to let the browser know that "this" is the main focus of the website.

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO).
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes.
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

## What is JavaScript

- 

- You can add JavaScript externally and internally by using the script tag.
