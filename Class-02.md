## Introduction To HTML

- **Semantic elements** are important because it makes sure we are using the correct elements.
- There are 6 heading elements *h1* *h2* ... *h6*
- *Sup* and *Sub* are used when marking up items like dates, chemical formulas, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning.
- When using the *abbr* element, *title* must be added to provide the full expansion of the term.

## Learn CSS 

- *Internal*, *external*, and *inline* styles are ways you can apply CSS to the HTML.
- Avoid using CSS when possible, because it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. Also it makes everything hard to read because its presented together with the HTML.

```
   h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }
```
- h2 is representing the selector
- The color and padding
- Black, and 5px are the properties.

## Learn JS

- *Strings* are enclosed in single quotes.
- Four types of operators are *addition*, *assignments*, *Strict equality*, *not/does-not-equal*.
- Turning on a light switch is a real world problem that can be solved with a function.
- An if statement checks a condition and if it evaluates to true, then the code block will execute.
- *Else if* are used when you are using one or more conditionals.
- Comparing operators are >, <, =.
- && means 'and' || means "or".
